## Introduction

The Waking-up System for Rear Window Defogger is an automated anti-fog system. This system combines the fog detection, automatic activation of defogger and driver notice properties. The fog detection property is achieved by gathering air temperature in the vehicle and the temperature and humidity of rear window glass. The system can predict the formation of fog and activate the fan at the rear window and beep the buzzer once to alert the driver. The fan would stop as the rear window is cleared. Furthermore, the users can monitor the temperature and humidity change in their vehicles during a period on the website “OpenChirp”.
